## General info
***
Locool Shoppers is an online platform that hosts a database of small, locally owned businesses in a particular location. Users can use this platform to shop for items as well as discover businesses in their communities. Our program utilizes C++, Qt creator, and SQ Lite.

## Usage
***
Upon running the program, a user is greeted with a pop up window with a geometric design on top and a button that says 'start shopping'. The user can click this button and will be greeted with another pop up window. Here the user can choose to 'Add Item', 'Add Store', 'Update Item', or 'Update Store'. Once the user has decided which type of data they'd like to add, they can type it into one of the listed text boxes. 'storeName', 'storeType', 'itemName', and 'itemType' are all fields that the user can enter information into. The user can then click 'View All Items' or 'View All Stores' to get an updated database of the respective lists of data.

* Businesses can register themselves or update their information.
* Products are able to be added and sorted based on their various properties.
* Buttons allow users to update the database with prices and items
